+ Is case sensitive\. For example, you can have a container named `myContainer` and a folder named `mycontainer` because those names are unique\.

+ Canâ€™t be renamed after it has been created\.

+ Can contain uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores \(\_\)\.

+ Must be from 3 to 255 characters long\.

# Rules for Container Names<a name="containers-rules-for-names"></a>

Container names must follow these rules:
+ Can contain uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores \(\_\)\.
+ Must be from 3 to 255 characters long\.
+ Canâ€™t be changed after the container has been created\.

**Note**  
Container names are case sensitive\. For example, you can have a container named `myContainer` and a folder named `mycontainer` because those names are unique\.

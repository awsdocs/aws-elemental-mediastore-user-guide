# Working with Containers in AWS Elemental MediaStore<a name="containers"></a>

You use containers in AWS Elemental MediaStore to store your folders and objects\. Related objects can be grouped in containers in the same way that you use a directory to group files in a file system\. You arenâ€™t charged when you create containers; you are charged only when you upload an object to a container\. For more information about charges, see [MediaStore Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/mediastore/pricing/)\.

# What Is AWS Elemental MediaStore?<a name="what-is"></a>

AWS Elemental MediaStore is a video origination and storage service that offers the high performance and immediate consistency required for live origination\. With MediaStore, you can manage video assets as objects in containers to build dependable, cloud\-based media workflows\.

To use the service, you upload your objects from a source, such as an encoder or data feed, to a container that you create in AWS Elemental MediaStore\.

AWS Elemental MediaStore is a great choice for storing fragmented video files when you need strong consistency, low\-latency reads and writes, and the ability to handle high volumes of concurrent requests\. If you are not delivering live streaming videos, consider using [Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/)\.

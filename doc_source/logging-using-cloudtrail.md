# Logging AWS Elemental MediaStore API Calls with AWS CloudTrail<a name="logging-using-cloudtrail"></a>

AWS Elemental MediaStore is integrated with AWS CloudTrail, a service that provides a record of actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service in MediaStore\. If you create a trail, you can enable continuous delivery of CloudTrail events to an Amazon S3 bucket, Amazon CloudWatch Logs, and Amazon CloudWatch Events\. Using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine the request that was made to MediaStore, the IP address from which the request was made, who made the request, when it was made, and additional details\. 

To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to configure and enable it, see the [AWS CloudTrail User Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/)\.

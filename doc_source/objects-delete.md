# Deleting an Object<a name="objects-delete"></a>

You can delete objects using the console or the AWS CLI\.

**Note**  
When you delete the only object in a folder, AWS Elemental MediaStore automatically deletes the folder and any empty folders above that folder\. For example, suppose that you have a folder named `premium` that doesnâ€™t contain any files but does contain one subfolder named `canada`\. The `canada` subfolder contains one file named `mlaw.ts`\. If you delete the file `mlaw.ts`, the service deletes both the `premium` and `canada` folders\. 

**To delete an object \(console\)**

1. Sign in to the AWS Elemental MediaStore console at **https://<*region*>\.console\.aws\.amazon\.com/mediastore/home/region=<*region*>**\.

1. On the **Containers** page, choose the name of container that has the object that you want to delete\.

1. If the object that you want to delete is in a folder, continue choosing the folder names until you see the object\.

1. Choose the radio button to the left of the object name\.

1.  Choose **Delete**\.

**To delete an object \(AWS CLI\)**

+ In the AWS CLI, use the **delete\-object** command\.

  Example:

  ```
  aws mediastore-data --region us-west-2 delete-object --endpoint=https://aaabbbcccdddee.data.mediastore.us-west-2.amazonaws.com --path=/test/document/README3.md
  ```

  This command has no return value\.

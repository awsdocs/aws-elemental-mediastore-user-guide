# Creating an Admin IAM User<a name="IAM-user-create"></a>

 When you first create an AWS account, you begin with a single sign\-in identity that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account\. This identity is called the AWS account *root user* and is accessed by signing in with the email address and password that you used to create the account\. We strongly recommend that you do not use the root user for your everyday tasks, even the administrative ones\. Instead, adhere to the [best practice of using the root user only to create your first IAM user](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#create-iam-users)\. Then securely lock away the root user credentials and use them to perform only a few account and service management tasks\.

In this procedure, you will use the AWS account root user to create your first IAM user\. You will add this IAM user to an Administrators group, to ensure that you have access to all services and their resources in your account\. The next time that you access your AWS account, you should sign in with the credentials for this IAM user\.

To create an IAM user with limited permissions, see [[ERROR] BAD/MISSING LINK TEXT](setting-up-IAM-users-create-nonadmin.md)\.

**To create an IAM user for yourself and add the user to an Administrators group**

1. Use your AWS account email address and password to sign in as the *[AWS account root user](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.html)* to the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.
**Note**  
We strongly recommend that you adhere to the best practice of using the **Administrator** user below and securely lock away the root user credentials\. Sign in as the root user only to perform a few [account and service management tasks](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tasks-that-require-root.html)\.

1. In the navigation pane of the console, choose **Users**, and then choose **Add user**\.

1. For **User name**, type ** Administrator**\.

1. Select the check box next to **AWS Management Console access**, select **Custom password**, and then type the new user's password in the text box\. You can optionally select **Require password reset** to force the user to select a new password the next time the user signs in\.

1. Choose **Next: Permissions**\.

1. On the **Set permissions for user** page, choose **Add user to group**\.

1. Choose **Create group**\.

1. In the **Create group** dialog box, type ** Administrators**\.

1. For **Filter**, choose **Job function**\.

1. In the policy list, select the check box for ** AdministratorAccess**\. Then choose **Create group**\.

1. Back in the list of groups, select the check box for your new group\. Choose **Refresh** if necessary to see the group in the list\.

1. Choose **Next: Review** to see the list of group memberships to be added to the new user\. When you are ready to proceed, choose **Create user**\.

You can use this same process to create more groups and users, and to give your users access to your AWS account resources\. To learn about using policies to restrict users' permissions to specific AWS resources, go to [Access Management](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access.html) and [Example Policies](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_examples.html)\.

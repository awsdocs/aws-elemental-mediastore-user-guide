# Rules for Folder Names<a name="folders-rules-for-names"></a>

Folder names must follow these rules:
+ Must be unique only within the parent container or folder\. For example, you can create a folder named `myfolder` in two different containers: `movies/myfolder` and `sports/myfolder`\.
+ Can have the same name as its parent container\.
+ Canâ€™t be changed after the folder has been created\.
+ Can contain uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, periods \(\.\), hyphens \(\-\), and tildes \(\~\)\.
+ Must start with a number or letter\.
+ Must be from 3 to 63 characters long\.
+ Must not be formatted as an IP address \(for example, 192\.168\.5\.4\)\.
+ Must not contain underscores \(\_\)\.
+ Must not end with a hyphen\.
+ Can't contain two, adjacent periods\.
+ Can't contain dashes next to periods \(e\.g\., my\-\.container\.com and my\.\-container are invalid\)\.

**Note**  
Folder names are case sensitive\. For example, you can have a container named `myFolder` and a folder named `myfolder` in the same container or folder because those names are unique\.

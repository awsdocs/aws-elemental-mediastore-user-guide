# Rules for folder names<a name="folders-rules-for-names"></a>

When you choose a name for your folder, remember the following:
+ The name can contain only the following characters: uppercase letters \(A\-Z\), lowercase letters \(a\-z\), numbers \(0\-9\), periods \(\.\), hyphens \(\-\), tildes \(\~\), underscores \(\_\), equal signs \(=\), and colons \(:\)\.
+ The name must be at least one character long\. Empty folder names \(such as `folder1//folder3/`\) are not allowed\. 
+ Names are case sensitive\. For example, you can have a folder named `myFolder` and a folder named `myfolder` in the same container or folder because those names are unique\.
+ The name must be unique only within its parent container or folder\. For example, you can create a folder named `myfolder` in two different containers: `movies/myfolder` and `sports/myfolder`\.
+ The name can have the same name as its parent container\.
+ The folder canâ€™t be renamed after it has been created\.

# Working with Objects in AWS Elemental MediaStore<a name="objects"></a>

AWS Elemental MediaStore assets are called *objects*\. You can upload an object to a container or to a folder within the container\.

In AWS Elemental MediaStore, you can upload, download, and delete objects: 
+ **Upload** – Add an object to a container or folder\. This is not the same as creating an object\. You must create your objects locally before you can upload them to AWS Elemental MediaStore\.
+ **Download** – Copy an object from AWS Elemental MediaStore to another location\. This does not remove the object from MediaStore\.
+ **Delete** – Remove an object from AWS Elemental MediaStore completely\.

AWS Elemental MediaStore accepts all file types\.
